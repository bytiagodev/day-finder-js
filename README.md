Day of the Week Finder

This was one of my first projects learning Frontend Development. I built this to practice how JavaScript handles dates and how to create modern UI effects like Glassmorphism.

What I learned with this project:

JavaScript Date Object: How to get the specific day of the week from a user input.

DOM Manipulation: Using JS to change the text on the screen without refreshing the page.

CSS Glassmorphism: Using backdrop-filter and transparency to create a "frosted glass" effect.

Responsive Design: Making sure the card looks good on both desktop and smartphone.
