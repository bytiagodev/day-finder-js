# 📅 Day of the Week Finder

![Status](https://img.shields.io/badge/Status-In--Progress-orange)

A simple and friendly web tool that identifies which day of the week corresponds to a selected date. This project was one of my first steps into Frontend Development, created to explore how JavaScript handles dates and how to build modern UI effects.

# ✨ About this project
I built this to practice the fundamentals of web development in a practical way. Instead of just reading about code, I wanted to see how a user input could be transformed into a dynamic result on the screen.

# 🧠 What I practiced:
*   **JavaScript Date Object:** Learning how to extract the specific weekday name from a user-selected date.
*   **DOM Manipulation:** Updating the text on the page dynamically without needing to refresh.
*   **Glassmorphism UI:** Experimenting with `backdrop-filter` and transparency to create a "frosted glass" look over a lake background.
*   **Responsive Design:** Making sure the interface stays centered and readable on both desktop and smartphones.
*   **Webkit Customization:** Learning how to style the native browser calendar icon to match a dark theme.

# 🛠️ Tech Stack
*   **HTML5** (Semantic structure)
*   **CSS3** (Glassmorphism, Flexbox, and Keyframe Animations)
*   **Vanilla JavaScript** (Date Object and DOM API)
