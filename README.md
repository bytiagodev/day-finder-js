✨ About this project

Built to practice the fundamentals of web development in a practical way. The app allows the user to select a date and instantly see which weekday it falls on, with a clean and simple interface.

🧠 What I practiced

JavaScript Date Object: Extracting the specific weekday from a user-selected date.
DOM Manipulation: Updating the page dynamically without refresh.
Glassmorphism UI: Using backdrop-filter and transparency to create a subtle frosted-glass effect over a background image.
Responsive Layout: Ensuring the interface remains centered and readable on desktop and mobile.
Webkit Customization: Styling the native calendar picker icon for dark themes.

🛠️ Tech Stack

HTML5 (Semantic structure)
CSS3 (Flexbox, Glassmorphism, Keyframe Animations)
Vanilla JavaScript (Date Object, DOM API)
